## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Basic CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm not new to HTML & CSS, so this activity was just to reinforce the basics. I'm currently apart of the #100devs bootcamp, and since we're at the beginning, I thought I'd do this project.

### Continued development

Throughout the bootcamp, I'm going to work on the projects that are aligned with the topics we're seeing within the bootcamp in order to have some extra practice that will reinforce what I'm learning.
